Comments on what is readable and what is not:
The file has good comments throughout to explain what is happening. I think the variables that are instantiated in the constructor may be useful to just 
instantiate in the definitions to make it obvious they are just constants being used.

In terms of quality:
This code is organized well and seems to use all required patterns. The enum for directions is a nice touch.

Proposed hypothetical change and its ease of implementation:
-Move() make the function not change functionality if the wrong incorrect values are passed 
into it. ie if x is not 0 then position.X += x/x*speed. This would be very easy to 
implement and would make it slightly more robust.
