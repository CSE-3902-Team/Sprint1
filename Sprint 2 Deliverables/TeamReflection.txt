Reflection: Our team was proficient this sprint. The team was able to meet the functionality requirements but we ended up not having adequate time to refactor code. There were avoidable and unavoidable factors that slowed us down in implementing functionality. Firstly, we didn’t use any task tracking software until much later in the sprint. As a result there was confusion on who was responsible for what tasks and workload wasn’t evenly distributed. Lastly, one of our group members could only work on the project at Caldwells labs during the first half of the sprint. This made it difficult to progress in enemies and players because we were waiting on projectiles to finish. But overall, despite all these shortcomings it’s great that the end product works and is largely, very high quality code.
