-Specific comments on what is readable and what is not
	The readability is overall fine. 
	I am not sure what some variables do, like the isRunning boolean. Maybe put a comment on that.
	The if statements are very easy to read and understand.

-Specific comments on code quality
	Overall the code quality is good.
	I think cohesion is good.
	Great use of a helper method with the boomerangs rotation.
	I think couppling a bit tight, there are seven different types being used, which could probably be improved on with more development.

-A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
	One change that could be made is to create an abstract class with the draw method, to stop the repeated code in all the draw methods of every class.
	I don't know if its good or bad, but making just one individual file for each projectile may be better so you don't have to hard code the source rectangle everytime, but
	if they are in an atlas they should be the same distance/increments.
