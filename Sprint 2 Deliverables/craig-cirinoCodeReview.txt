Readability Comments:
	- Could be more clear with parameter names for "setBatchPosition".
	- In the previousItem and nextItem, could create an int variable called lastItem at the beginning and use that in the "if" statements.
	- Similarly, in the CreateItemSprite method, could create a variable of type AItem at the beginning and have the switch cases update that variable and only have 1 return statement at the end.
	- make methods start with capital letter

Code Quality Comments:
	- Could remove setBatchSprite method by passing in the Spritebatch and Vector2 to the constructor and encapsulating them in the private fields.
	- Code is easily maintainable by simply adding enumerations and switch cases for new items
	- Code has loose coupling 

Overall, I believe the ItemSpriteFactory is quality code but could use some small touchups such as adding variables for readibility as suggested above or to make CreateItemSprite only have 1 return statement. 

In our game we could make an enemy Sprite Factory similar to this one. That would clean up the Game1 LoadContent and Draw method. Using this sprite factory as a guide, I believe an enemy sprite factory would not be too difficult to implement with our current implementation of the game.
